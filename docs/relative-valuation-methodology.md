# Relative Valuation Methodology Documentation

## Overview

The Relative Valuation Calculator is a comprehensive tool for comparing companies against industry peers using multiple valuation ratios. This method helps identify whether a stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued by comparing key financial metrics to those of comparable companies.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Core Valuation Multiples

#### 1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

**Formula:**
```
P/E = Market Capitalization / Net Income
P/E = Price per Share / Earnings per Share
```

**Application:**
- Best for mature, profitable companies with consistent earnings
- Compares relative price investors pay for each dollar of earnings
- Higher P/E suggests higher growth expectations or overvaluation

**Limitations:**
- Not meaningful for loss-making companies
- Can be distorted by one-time charges or gains
- Accounting differences can affect comparability

#### 2. PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings-to-Growth)

**Formula:**
```
PEG = P/E Ratio / Growth Rate (%)
PEG = (Price / Earnings) / Expected Growth Rate
```

**Application:**
- Incorporates growth expectations into P/E analysis
- Ideal for comparing companies with different growth rates
- PEG < 1 suggests undervaluation, PEG > 1 suggests overvaluation

**Limitations:**
- Relies on growth estimates which may be inaccurate
- Short-term growth may not reflect long-term prospects
- Different growth calculation methods affect results

#### 3. Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio

**Formula:**
```
P/S = Market Capitalization / Revenue
P/S = Price per Share / Sales per Share
```

**Application:**
- Useful for comparing companies regardless of profitability
- Less affected by accounting differences than earnings-based ratios
- Particularly valuable for high-growth, loss-making companies

**Limitations:**
- Ignores profitability and cost structure differences
- Can hide operational efficiency problems
- Quality of revenue (recurring vs. one-time) matters

#### 4. Enterprise Value-to-Sales (EV/Sales)

**Formula:**
```
EV/Sales = Enterprise Value / Revenue
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash
```

**Application:**
- Capital structure neutral comparison
- Better for comparing companies with different debt levels
- Useful in M&A analysis and capital-intensive industries

**Limitations:**
- Ignores profitability like P/S
- Enterprise value calculation can vary by methodology
- Cash treatment may differ across companies

#### 5. Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)

**Formula:**
```
EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA
EBITDA = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
```

**Application:**
- Compares operating performance before capital structure effects
- Useful for capital-intensive businesses with significant depreciation
- Standard metric in M&A and LBO analysis

**Limitations:**
- EBITDA ignores capital expenditure requirements
- May not reflect true cash generation
- Accounting treatment of items like stock-based compensation varies

#### 6. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio

**Formula:**
```
P/B = Market Capitalization / Book Value of Equity
P/B = Price per Share / Book Value per Share
```

**Application:**
- Measures market value relative to accounting book value
- Particularly relevant for asset-heavy industries
- Traditional value investing metric

**Limitations:**
- Book value may not reflect fair market value of assets
- Less relevant for asset-light, technology companies
- Accounting methods affect book value calculations

## Peer Selection Methodology

### Industry Classification

**Primary Criteria:**
- Same or similar GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) codes
- Similar business models and revenue sources
- Comparable regulatory environments
- Geographic market overlap where relevant

**Secondary Factors:**
- Similar business maturity and life cycle stage
- Comparable customer base and end markets
- Similar seasonality patterns
- Comparable capital intensity

### Size Considerations

**Market Capitalization Bands:**
- Large Cap: > $10B
- Mid Cap: $2B - $10B
- Small Cap: $300M - $2B
- Micro Cap: < $300M

**Size Matching Principles:**
- Use companies within 2-3 size bands when possible
- Consider absolute size differences (e.g., 10x rule)
- Account for size-related premium/discount effects
- Adjust for liquidity differences in smaller companies

### Growth Profile Matching

**Growth Rate Categories:**
- High Growth: >20% revenue/earnings growth
- Moderate Growth: 5-20% growth
- Low Growth: 0-5% growth
- Declining: <0% growth

**Growth Consistency:**
- Evaluate historical growth volatility
- Consider cyclicality and seasonal patterns
- Assess sustainability of growth drivers
- Factor in management guidance and analyst expectations

### Profitability Screening

**Minimum Thresholds:**
- Positive gross margins
- Operating margins above industry minimum
- Positive EBITDA for mature companies
- Consistent profitability trend

**Quality Metrics:**
- Return on equity (ROE) consistency
- Return on invested capital (ROIC) levels
- Free cash flow generation
- Working capital management efficiency

## Statistical Analysis Framework

### Outlier Detection and Removal

**Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:**
```
Lower Bound = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
Upper Bound = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
IQR = Q3 - Q1
```

**Application:**
- Remove companies with multiples outside 1.5 × IQR range
- Maintain minimum of 5 companies after outlier removal
- Document exclusions with specific reasons
- Consider industry-specific adjustment factors

### Peer Group Statistics

**Central Tendency Measures:**
- **Median:** Preferred for skewed distributions
- **Mean:** Used when distribution is approximately normal
- **Trimmed Mean:** Average after removing top/bottom 10%

**Variability Measures:**
- **Standard Deviation:** Absolute measure of dispersion
- **Coefficient of Variation:** Relative measure (σ/μ)
- **Range:** Difference between max and min values
- **Interquartile Range:** Spread of middle 50% of data

### Percentile Analysis

**Positioning Framework:**
- **Premium Tier:** 75th-100th percentile (top quartile)
- **Market Tier:** 25th-75th percentile (middle two quartiles)
- **Discount Tier:** 0th-25th percentile (bottom quartile)
- **Deep Discount:** Below 10th percentile
